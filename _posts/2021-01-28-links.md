I put together a new track and made it available on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/gorsuch/2021-01-27-01a/):

I'm trying to get better at cataloging and sharing my music.  I may eventually build a separate index just for those tracks, as a means of developing a portfolio of sorts. 

Today's links:
- I greatly enjoyed [this writeup](https://github.blog/2021-01-25-improving-how-we-deploy-github/) on the evolution of GitHub's internal deployment system.  As a person who strongly admired the original system (I still believe it was the BEST I've ever seen), and as someone who worked on improving it, I always wondered how it would progress as the company grew even larger.  Inserting a state machine in the process makes perfect sense, of course
- [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-_8tj0REkA) by Sonic State w/ Alessandro Cortini on the new Make Noise Strega is a great watch
- [Also checkout the official Make Noise announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IBXTMnTBnM)
- I completed 30 days of the Sleep Pack on [Headspace](https://headspace.com/) today.  I'm now moving on to the 'Pro' pack, working on getting used to sitting without guidance for ~20 minutes each day.  I highly recommend the app if you have the opportunity to check it out -- it's a fantastic way to ease into the practice.  My only minor quibble is the lack of more 'advanced' meditation teachings, but you can pick up the books, find a teacher, etc, for those.  This is a good way to build the foundations and get going

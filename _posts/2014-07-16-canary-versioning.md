title: Canary Component Versioning
---

I wanted to drop a small note mentioning that [canary.io components](https://github.com/canaryio) are now being versioned via [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

It is my hope that this will make it much easier to communicate the scope of change, help prevent breakage, and allow for the use of services such as [gopkg.in](http://labix.org/gopkg.in).

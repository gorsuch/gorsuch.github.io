title: Status Update
---

It's been a long, long time since I've written anything at all.  So here are some brief notes to at least give some status:

## Family

I am married and have two kids.  Twin daughters, to be more specific.  They are wonderful and give me a good reason to keep my nose clean.

We have a dog, Starbuck, named after the character from the reimagined [_Battlestar Galactica_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica).  I really have no idea why we did that, but it works.

## Work

I am happily employed at [Simple](https://www.simple.com/), focusing on technical operations.  They are a remote-friendly company, and I live and work out of my home in Oklahoma City.

## Current Readings

Currently trying on making sense of [Satipatthana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satipatthana) in both theory and practice.  I'm leaning on the following works:

* [_Satipatthana: The Direct Path to Realization_](http://www.amazon.com/Satipatthana-The-Direct-Path-Realization/dp/1899579540)
* [_Perspectives on Satipatthana_](http://www.amazon.com/Perspectives-Satipatthana-Bhikkhu-Analayo/dp/190931403X/)
* [_Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening_](http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-A-Practical-Guide-Awakening/dp/162203063X/)

## Political Leanings

I'm still pretty damned liberal, regardless of my cynical trips.

## Side Projects

[canary.io](http://www.canary.io/) is my baby.  I've neglected it over the past month as I transitioned to my new job, but it has a lot of good things coming up.

For a preview, keep an eye on [`gorsuch/canary`](https://github.com/gorsuch/canary), my experimental reboot of the service offering.

## Development Environment

I do most of work inside a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) instance, maintained by [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home).  I ssh in, and use `tmux`, `vim` and `irssi` to get things done.  I don't like to customize.

## Programming Language of Choice

[go](http://golang.org/) wherever applicable.  I'm still a newb, but the language and community have been wonderful so far.

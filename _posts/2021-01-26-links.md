Hello!

I'm currently on a brief sabbatical from the workforce, and part of that means remembering to enjoy writing again.

In order to do that, I'm starting a small link blog.  I'm uncertain how often I will publish, which is also part of the terms of my time off.  Maybe I'll even write something from time to time.

Today's links:
- This site has been rebooted via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  Source can be found [here](https://github.com/gorsuch/gorsuch.github.io). 
- I forgot how much I missed [TextMate](https://macromates.com) as a text editor
- Here's a [ 2013 interview w/ Steve Hagen via The Secular Buddhist Podcast](http://www.thesecularbuddhist.com/episode_070.php).  Picking up the thread of a long running fascination with alternative modes of perception, I listened to [Living As the True Self](http://dharmatalks.dharmafield.org/normrandolph/N294%20Living%20As%20the%20True%20Self.mp3) from [Dharma Field](https://www.dharmafield.org/recent-talks.html) (Steve's organization)
- Marco Rogers [highlights the lack of 'real talk' in white culture](https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1353902811868618758)
- 'Tornado Alley' [is an outdated concept](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/05/16/tornado-alley-flawed-concept/)
